In this tutorial we will build on our previous tutorial in which we created a todo list smart contract. Our goal is to build a front end that can be deployed to a web server to allow users to interact with our smart contract through a GUI.

This is part 3 of a 4 part series on how to develop smart contracts on the Koinos blockchain.

- Part 1 on setting up the dev environment can be found [here](https://learnkoinos.xyz/docs/modules/M4/1_introduction.html).
- Part 2 on building the smart contract can be found [here](https://learnkoinos.xyz/docs/modules/M8/1_todos.html).

We will use HTML, CSS and vanilla JS but you can use Vue, React, Svelte etc. Itâ€™s also possible to connect to the smart contract using Swift or Kotlin on mobile. In this tutorial we are using the Kondor wallet Chrome extension, we can also use [WalletConnect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@armana/walletconnect-koinos-sdk-js) but that is out of the scope of this exercise. We will need a test account in Kondor with some tKoin.
